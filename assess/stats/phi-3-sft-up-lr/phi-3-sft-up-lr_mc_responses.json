If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\n3 researchers offer their reasoning and answer in response to this question. Researcher A offers answer A, researcher B offers answer B, and researcher C offers answer C. Which answer is correct?\n\nA. Let's think step by step\nOne tomato cut into 8 slices provides one-eighth of a meal.\n20 slices provide a full meal.\nTherefore, one whole tomato can provide 20/8 = 2.5 meals.\nA family of 8 needs 8 meals, so Thelma will need 8/2.5 = 3.2 tomatoes.\nSince Thelma can't cut a tomato into .2, she needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 4 tomatoes.\nThe answer is 4\n\nB. Let's think step by step\nFor a meal for a single person, Thelma needs 20 slices of fried green tomato\nFor a family of 8 people, Thelma will need 8*20=160 slices of fried green tomato\nIf each green tomato is cut into 8 slices, then Thelma will need to cut 160/8=20 tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal.\nThe answer is 20\n\nC. Given that Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices, and that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, we start by finding how many tomatoes are needed for one person's meal: 20 slices / 8 slices per tomato = 2.5 tomatoes. Since we can't have half a tomato for a meal, we'll need to round up to three whole tomatoes because even if we cut precisely, 2.5 includes just 2 slices, and a full tomato would contribute more.\n\nTo feed a family of 8 for a single meal using the same cut-up method (where 20 slices per family member), we would need: 3 tomatoes per person * 8 people = 24 tomatoes.\n\nThe answer is 24.\n\nFor an unusual rounding scenario to ensure enough food, Thelma could cut one additional tomato into 6 slices (resulting in 4 extra slices, bringing the total to 24) to round up so that each person in the family of 8 receives at least a full portion of two tomatoes worth of slices each. However, based on our calculation of 3 tomatoes per person, the precise answer is 24 tomatoes.\n\nThis takes into account that Thelma doesn't want to cut tomatoes into fractions but ensures that there is at least one full tomato per person. However, it's important to note that in practical cooking terms, you could likely adjust the slice sizes slightly to perfectly use whole tomatoes, but strictly from the given information and sticking with whole tomatoes, the answer would be 24."

He bought an 11-ounce bottle of vehicle wax, but spilled 2 ounces before using it. How many ounces does he have left after waxing his car and SUV?\n3 researchers offer their reasoning and answer in response to this question. Researcher A offers answer A, researcher B offers answer B, and researcher C offers answer C. Which answer is correct?\n\nA: Let's think step by step\nKellan used 3 ounces + 4 ounces = 7 ounces of wax to detail both his car and SUV.\nHe initially had 11 ounces of wax, but spilled 2 ounces, leaving him with a total of 11 - 2 = 9 ounces.\nAfter detailing his car and SUV, Kellan used 7 ounces of wax, so he has 9 - 7 = 2 ounces of wax left.\nThe answer is 2 ounces.\n\nB: Let's think step by step\nKellan spilled 2 ounces, so he started with 11+2=13 ounces.\nThe total wax used waxing Kellan's car and SUV is 4+4=8 ounces.\nSo, he has 13-8=5 ounces left after waxing his car and SUV.\nThe answer is 5 ounces.\n\nC: Let's think step by step\nKellan needs 4.0 ounces to detail his car and another 4.0 ounces for his SUV, totalling 4.0+4.0=8.0 ounces.\nHe initially bought an 11-ounce bottle of wax, but spilled 2 ounces, leaving him with 11-2=9 ounces of wax.\nAfter using 8 ounces of wax on his car and SUV, he has 9-8=1 ounce of wax left.\nThe answer is 1 ounce."
